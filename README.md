# Setup

## Images
1. Place the main poster image in `src/assets/images/hero/`. Name it anything (e.g., `poster.jpg`). Only the first image found will be used.
2. Place gallery images in `src/assets/images/gallery/`. These will be automatically loaded and displayed in the showcase grid.

## Content
Edit the markdown files in `src/content/` to update text:
- `show.md`: Hero section title and tagline
- `groups.md`: Benefits section text
- `dates.md`: Performance schedule and contact info

## Development
Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
Run `npm run build` to build for production.
